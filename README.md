# Good-habits-reminder

This is another fun project. 

It's broken down into several parts

What part 1 does is to extract good habits from a website I pass it to. 

In part 2, it stores those habits in an SQL databse I created. 

In part 3, it sends messages to my phone to remind me to do said habbits.

I am using a virtual phone number from Twilio which I then used to automate the texting of said reminders.
